# About My Range Application (MyRangeBC) for Web

The Range Mobile Pathfinder project is developing a suite of applications to support the sustainable management of cattle range on crown lands in British Columbia. [Learn more about the Range Program](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hra/)

The goal is to move important crown land management documents from paper to digital, and to make this information accessible in the field through disconnected mobile devices. This also supports a new and consistent process for Range staff across the province to support decision making processes.

An Agile Scrum team developed the Alpha product to test basic fuctions and was done March 31, 2018. Future releases by the Kamloops Range team at Kamloops Innovation Centre will lead towards an application that can be used by staff and public range use agreement holders, on multiple platforms.

For the Alpha Release, the web application documented here allows Range Branch Staff to view Range Use Plans that have been created in the iOS application. Soon, Range Officers will also be able to create and maintain records on web, but the offline abilities remain an iOS only feature for the time being. It also enables users to assign staff to a set of agreements they are responsible for managing.

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

## Environment variables

```bash
REACT_APP_SSO_REALM_NAME= # Realm name for SSo
REACT_APP_SSO_CLIENT_ID= # Client ID for SSO
REACT_APP_API_URL= # API URL. Hosted dev API is at https://web-range-myra-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/api.
```

There are example environment variables in `.env.example` that you can copy into `.env`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm test -- --coverage`

Launches the test runner with a coverage report.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br><br>

In `/semantic` directory, you can also run:

## Running E2E tests with Cypress

To begin, start the E2E API. This is a separate docker-compose environment from what you may use normally for local development, and must be running for the end-to-end tests to work.

```bash
npm run test:e2e:api:start
```

> If you want to completely remove the end-to-end API, you can run `npm run test:e2e:api:clean`.

Then, to open Cypress in development mode:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

Alternatively, if you just want to run the E2E tests in a headless environment:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:run
```

### `gulp build`

Builds all files for Semantic UI including js, css, and assets. Build tool settings are stored in semantic.json.

## Create React App

The application was built on top of [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [Redux selector pattern](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-reducers-selectors.md#selectors) for state management and [React Router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing & code splitting. The project was ejected once to add more plugins and make changes in Webpack configuration, then it was switched back to the unejected state with the newer version since it took care of all the demands.

## Routing & Code Splitting

This project takes advantage of React Router v4 to acheive many things such as authentication, authorizing users based on their roles, code splitting, dynamic route matching and so on.

Create React App allows us to dynamically import parts of our app using the `import()` proposal to reduce initial load time. Related reference can be found [here](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/code-splitting-in-create-react-app.html).

## Styling

- [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage) was chosen for the main css framework. It includes Gulp build tools so the project can preserve its own theme changes, allowing us to customise the style variables. Detailed documentation on theming in Semantic UI can be found [here](http://learnsemantic.com/developing/customizing.html).

- [BEM(Block Element Modifier)](http://getbem.com/introduction) methodology was chosen for naming convention.

- Integration with Sass

- Post-Processing CSS

  ```css
  .App {
    display: flex;
  }
  ```

  becomes this:

  ```css
  .App {
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: flex;
  }
  ```
